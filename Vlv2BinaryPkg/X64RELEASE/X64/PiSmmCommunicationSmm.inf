#  PI SMM Communication SMM driver that installs the SMM Communication ACPI Table.
#
#  This SMM driver installs the SMM Communication ACPI Table defined in the UEFI spec
#  which provides a mechanism that can be used in the OS present environment by
#  non-firmware agents for inter-mode communication with SMM agents. It also saves
#  SMM communication context for use by SMM Communication PEIM in the S3 boot mode.
